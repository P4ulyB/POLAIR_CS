here is a design request i gave claude code....


GOAL: The goal of this is to create a basic object spawner that uses the object pooling system.
I'd like to attach the PACS_SpawnManager data asset to the Game mode (or wherever you best decide) which contains an association between 
the 'Spawn Classes' and the projects Blueprints. Once that association is made - i'd like to place the spawner in the level, select the 'Spawn Class',
hit play and the object pooling system populates the map with the desired assets. 

CONTEXT:

The reason why i asked for these files to be deleted in my initial request this session, was because these classes were littered with dependencies and hard references. 
This was my fault for not validating steps incrementally when building.
I'd like to rebuild some of these components from scratch and i'd like to start with a 'spawn manager' subsystem. 

I recall that the spawner subsystem was responsible for holding data regarding NPC types and settings.
The types of 'spawnable classes' should be as follows...

Human.Police
Human.QAS
Human.QFRS
Human.Civ
Human.POI

Veh.Police
Veh.QAS
Veh.QFRS
Veh.Civ
Veh.VOI

Env.Fire
Env.Smoke

I recall there was a data asset that we placed in our Game Mode class. The intention of the data asset was to assign
Blueprint assets to the 'spawnable classes'.

The third part was the spawner, where you would place a spawner in the map, select the 'Spawnable Class' (eg. Human.Police), then on begin play, it would spawn
that blueprint at that location. 

The fourth part was the Spawn Pool. this was designed specifically to be an optimisation for use in a multiplayer dedicated server environment using the
object pooling system. 

These systems in principle existed in this project but it was never correctly implemented. 

I'd like you to attempt to implement it again. 

CONSTRAINTS: 

1. No hard references 
2. Use smart pointers where the benefit is clear 
3. Use interfaces when necessary 
4. Create and use a blueprint function library in C++ to keep code tidy and avoid repeating code when the benefit is clear

Here is the output it gave me...

Thought for 17s
Spawn System (Pooling) — Critical Review & Pragmatic Rework
Below is a blunt, practical pass over the design with a focus on dedicated server, replication behaviour, and simplicity. I’ll call out critical gaps, then give a leaner architecture and hard rules to keep you out of trouble.

Critical Gaps (must address)
Pooling replicated AActors is risky by default

Issue: UE’s networking assumes a spawn→replicate→destroy lifecycle. Reusing the same actor instance keeps its NetGUID, dormancy state, and replication history alive. If you don’t hard‑reset replication state, clients can see stale state, missing initial replication, or channels stuck dormant.

Consequence: Subtle desync, “why didn’t this update?” bugs, and channel churn.

Too many subsystems for the job

You’ve proposed: data asset + object pool GI subsystem + spawn manager world subsystem + spawn point actor + poolable interface + function library.

Smell: Manager + separate pool subsystem is duplication. One orchestrator is enough.

GameMode attachment for config

GameMode exists server‑only and is not persistent across seamless travel the way you think. You want per‑world, server‑authoritative access. UWorldSubsystem is a better owner for runtime orchestration; the config can live in DeveloperSettings or a DA accessed by the subsystem.

Enum for types limits extensibility

Your taxonomy (Human.Police, Veh.QAS, …) screams Gameplay Tags, not an enum. Enums will force engine rebuilds for additions. Tags let designers extend without code churn and natively support hierarchies.

Async asset loading not scoped to server lifecycle

If classes are soft and you asynchronously load at BeginPlay, you must handle load failure, late loads during travel, and re-entrancy (multiple spawns queued while a class is loading). No plan shown.

Level/streaming ownership of pooled actors

If you spawn pooled actors into a streamed sub‑level that unloads, the pool gets GC’d or actors are destroyed. Pools should live in the Persistent Level and spawn actors into that level, or you need one pool per streaming level.

No explicit replication/dormancy strategy

Returning an actor to the pool must: set hidden, disable collision, stop ticking, clear owner/instigator, set NetDormancy to DORM_Initial or DORM_DormantAll, and possibly close actor channel if it won’t be reused soon. None of this is specified.

Effects should not be AActors

Env.Fire, Env.Smoke should be Niagara (or component) pooling, not full actors. Pooling actors for short‑lived FX bloats replication and tick.

ACharacter pooling

Characters bring CharacterMovementComponent state, capsule, navmesh agents, animations. Reusing them safely requires deep reset (movement mode, velocity, compressed flags, ability system state, animation state). This is non‑trivial and often slower than respawn for low counts.

Recommended Simpler Architecture (server‑first)
Keep only two runtime pieces + one config:
UPACS_SpawnOrchestrator : UWorldSubsystem (single owner)

Loads config (soft) and owns all pools.

Provides Acquire(SpawnTag, FTransform, FSpawnParams) and Release(AActor&).

Pre‑warms pools on server only (clients never pre‑spawn).

Integrates with Replication Graph/Significance Manager hooks (optional but ideal).

APACS_SpawnPoint (placeable)

Designer picks a GameplayTag (PACS.Spawn.Human.Police etc.) and optional count/wave pattern.

On server BeginPlay, asks Orchestrator to Acquire instances. Clients do nothing.

Optional “autorespawn” policy is data‑driven.

UPACS_SpawnConfig : UPrimaryDataAsset (or UDeveloperSettings)

Map: FGameplayTag -> FSpawnClassConfig where FSpawnClassConfig holds:

TSoftClassPtr<AActor> (no hard references),

pool sizes (initial/max),

spawn policy (replicates? tear-off? lifespan?),

relevance (cull distance class, significance threshold),

level ownership (persistent vs named sub‑level pool).

Why this wins: one orchestrator = one codepath for load/spawn/reset; SpawnPoint stays dumb; tags allow extensibility; no GI + World subsystem double‑up.

Hard Rules (networking & pooling)
Authority first: Any mutating method starts with ensure(HasAuthority()).

Server spawns only: Clients receive via replication. Never client‑spawn pooled actors for replicated gameplay.

Pool in Persistent Level: Or explicitly create separate pools per streaming level; avoid cross‑level ownership.

Reset on Release (minimum):

SetActorHiddenInGame(true), SetActorEnableCollision(false), SetActorTickEnabled(false).

Clear Owner, Instigator, detach from parents, zero velocities/state, clear timers/delegates.

Replication: ForceNetUpdate(); SetNetDormancy(DORM_DormantAll) or close channel if long idle. Consider TearOff() for one‑shot projectiles instead of pooling.

Reset on Acquire (minimum):

Ensure class fully loaded (await soft class load).

FinishSpawning path if deferred; set transform; re‑enable tick/collision; set dormancy to DORM_Awake; call ForceNetUpdate() for clean initial state.

Interface only for lifecycle hooks:

IPoolable::OnAcquire/OnRelease for actor‑specific resets. Keep it minimal to avoid a heavy interface.

ACharacter caution: If you must pool characters, implement a comprehensive state reset (CMC, GAS, AnimInstance). Otherwise, prefer destroy+spawn; measure.

Data & Editor flow
Gameplay Tags over Enum: Define a hierarchical tag set:

PACS.Spawn.Human.Police, PACS.Spawn.Vehicle.QAS, PACS.Spawn.Env.Fire, PACS.Spawn.Res.HealthPack etc.

Config authoring: Designers map Tag → SoftClass, sizes, policy. Add editor validation:

Missing class, non‑replicated class mapped to “replicated” policy, ACharacter in a pool flagged as warn.

Loading: The orchestrator resolves soft classes server‑side on demand, with a simple async queue per class to coalesce concurrent requests.

Replication & Relevancy specifics
Replication Graph: When an actor is released, remove from active nodes or mark “not relevant”; when acquired, re‑add to the appropriate spatial node. Avoid toggling dormancy every frame—batch state changes.

Significance Manager: Drive tick/anim budget; for pooled inactive actors, set significance = 0, disable ticks entirely.

Cull distance: Set NetCullDistanceSquared appropriately per type via your FSpawnClassConfig.

Initial‑only data: If actors have expensive initial data, consider Initial‑Only replication or condensed init RPC on first acquire after pool wake.

What to not pool
Niagara / FX: Use component pooling or Niagara’s own systems; do not pool FX actors.

One‑shot projectiles: TearOff + destroy usually beats pooling; channels are short‑lived and cheap.

Rare spawns (count < 5): Don’t pre‑warm; lazy spawn on demand.

Slimmed File Set (rename where useful)
Subsystems/PACS_SpawnOrchestrator.h/.cpp — the orchestrator (UWorldSubsystem).

Data/PACS_SpawnConfig.h/.uasset — tag → soft class + policy.

Actors/PACS_SpawnPoint.h/.cpp — thin placeable, server‑only behaviour.

Interfaces/PACS_Poolable.h — two methods; keep tiny.

Libraries/PACS_SpawnBPLibrary.h/.cpp — only generic helpers that are actually reused (avoid dumping logic here).

(Drop ObjectPoolSubsystem and SpawnManagerSubsystem. One orchestrator.)

Edge Cases & Failure Modes (plan now)
Async load fails: Fallback to spawn‑on‑demand with log warning; don’t crash. Mark tag “degraded”.

Seamless travel: Destroy pools on Deinitialize; rebuild on Initialize; avoid leaking pointers to old World.

Streaming unload: If pooling per sub‑level, flush pool when level unloads (release -> destroy).

Re‑entrancy: Multiple Acquire while class is loading must queue promises and resolve once.

Threading: All spawn/release runs on game thread. Do not touch actor state off‑thread.

Optimisation Opportunities (cheap wins)
Batch pre‑warm: Spawn pooled actors with SpawnActorDeferred, set flags, then FinishSpawning in batches per frame to avoid hitches.

Class‑local free lists: One TPimpl per class for faster lookups; avoid hashing tags every call.

Conditional ticks: Even when active, use significance to halve/quarter tick rates of low‑priority AI; pool only solves spawn cost, not ongoing tick cost.

Metrics: Track acquire misses, pool pressure, average active count. If miss rate is low, shrink pools.

Minimal API sketch (intent only)
Acquire(Tag, Transform, Params) -> AActor*

Loads class if needed; returns a live actor (server only). On clients this should never be called.

Release(AActor*)

Resets & parks the actor, manages replication state.

Prewarm(Tag, Count)

Server‑only; safe during BeginPlay and on demand.

Strong Opinion (TL;DR)
Cut the system to: one orchestrator + spawn point + config.

Use Gameplay Tags, not enums.

Do not pool Characters unless you’re ready to fully reset CMC/anim/GAS.

Prefer component/FX pooling for Env.*.

Be explicit about replication state on acquire/release, or don’t pool replicated actors at all.
